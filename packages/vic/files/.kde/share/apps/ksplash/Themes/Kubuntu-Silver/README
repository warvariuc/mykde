Kubuntu-Silver ksplash theme

Animated ksplash (KDE SC splash screen) theme for kubuntu. The default background is very simple to keep the download size small, use one of your own if you wish.

Customizing:
To change the background:
- Two default colors available in the package (black and blue), edit config file (./1920x1080/description.txt) to switch between them.
- You can also replace background.png with an image of your choosing in the subfolders for different resolutions (make sure your image has the right resolution). You can use a different file name or format if you edit the config file (./1920x1080/description.txt) accordingly. 
   (if there is no subfolder for the resolution you use, you can create one.)

Using different versions:
- There are three versions of splash-image "box" within the theme (gradient, transparent and black). To choose between them, edit the theme config file (./1920x1080/description.txt) by uncommenting/commenting the corresponding lines as necessary.
